# Description
This is a classification project with the KNN algorithm with a toy/simulated dataset. We will use sk-learn Python library to carry out the analysis.     
  

Here is the corresponding [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/cjlise/MachineLearning/blob/master/KNN-Project/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20Project%20Portfolio.ipynb).
