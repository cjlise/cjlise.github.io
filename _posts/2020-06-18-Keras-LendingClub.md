# Description
Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), can we build a model that can predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan. Keep in mind classification metrics when evaluating the performance of your model.    
  

Here is the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/cjlise/MachineLearning/blob/master/DeepLearning/Keras-Project-LendingClub.ipynb).
