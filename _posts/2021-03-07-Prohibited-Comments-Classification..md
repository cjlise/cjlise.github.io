This work is inspired by an exercise from the course [NLP Course](https://lena-voita.github.io/nlp_course.html). The goal is to build a model to ban offensive social media comments. The dataset is rather small (it contains about 3500 comments). For this study, we will:  
* Build from scratch a Naive Bayes classifier using Bag of Words features 
* Compare the Naive Bayes classifier with a logistic regression model
* Compare logistic regression model with bag of words features with TF-IDF features 
* Use word vectors features   
 
The details are available in the linked [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/cjlise/MachineLearning/blob/master/NLP-Course/prohibited_comments_classification.ipynb).
