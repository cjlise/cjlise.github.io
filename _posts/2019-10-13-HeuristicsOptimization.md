# Genetics algorithms Lab Report
The goal of this lab is to show the limits of gradient based algorithms. They are compared to the genetics algorithms when there are several local minima. And we see that sometimes the gradient based algorithm are trapped in local minima whereas the genetics algorithm are always able to find the global minima. however the convergence speed is one drawback of those algorithm.
