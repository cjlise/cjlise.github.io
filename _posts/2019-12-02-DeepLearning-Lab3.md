# Deep Learning Lab 3
This lab shows the steps involved in the training and testing of an image classifier:    
 
* Load and normalizing the CIFAR10 training and test datasets using torchvision
* Define a Convolutional Neural Network
* Define a Loss function and optimizer
* Train the network
* Test the network on the test data
