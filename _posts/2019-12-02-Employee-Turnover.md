# Employees turnover study using survival analysis
The goal of this project is to carry out the analysis of employee churn. We will work with a dataset available on [github](https://github.com/ludovicbenistant/Management-Analytics/blob/master/HR/HR.csv). The dataset description is also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/employee-churn-prediction/data), althouth it cannot be freely downloaded from there.

The R notebook corresponding to this lab is available [here](https://github.com/cjlise/MachineLearning/blob/master/SurvivalAnalysis/SurvivalAnalysis-cjlise.Rmd).

Here is the [Notebook HTML rendering](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/cjlise/MachineLearning/blob/master/SurvivalAnalysis/SurvivalAnalysis-cjlise.html).
