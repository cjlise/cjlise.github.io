# Deep Learning Lab 1
This lab covers is basically a <a href="https://pytorch.org/">pyTorch </a> tensors tutorial. At the end a simple linear regression model is presented. 

Here is the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T6x-ToztavZ1DJf5FBFDQQA54rm6xo6q">link</a> to access the notebook on Google colab. It doesn't work directly on github.
