# SQL in memory division using Python
The goal of this project is to replicate an in memory SQL division using Python. This can be done directly in SQL, but here we are interested to do the same in Python with a relational database on Microsoft SQLServer. For this task we use the [revoscale Python library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/advanced-analytics/python/ref-py-revoscalepy?view=sql-server-ver15).   

The complete code is available [here](https://github.com/cjlise/SoftwareEngineering/blob/master/SQLInMemoryDivision.py).
