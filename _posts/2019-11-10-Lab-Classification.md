# Lab classification and dimensionality reduction
The goal of this lab is to cover Logistic Regression and dimension reduction (PCA). This lab is inspired by the Harvard course [2018-CS109A](https://github.com/Harvard-IACS/2018-CS109A).    

The notebook corresponding to this lab is available [here](https://github.com/cjlise/MachineLearning/blob/master/Lab-Classification/LabClassification.ipynb).
