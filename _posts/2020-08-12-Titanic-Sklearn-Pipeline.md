# Titanic Dataset Analysis with Scikit-Learn Pipeline
The goal is to carry out the Titanic data classification analysis in Python using Scikit-Learn library. We will still use the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) web site. The goal here is to use the Scikit-Learn Pipeline API to automate the pre-processing and feature engineering tasks. After setting up the Pipeline, we test a few models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
