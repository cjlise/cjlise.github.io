# Statistics Learning Project Lab Report
This lab covers numerical calculation with the normal distribution, estimators, statistics tests, parameter distribution and confidence interval. 
The R markdown notebook with the lab results is  <a href="https://github.com/cjlise/MachineLearning/blob/master/FSML-2.Rmd">here.</a> 

As Github doesn't provide a gentle rendering of the R notebook, the PDF rendering is available <a href="https://github.com/cjlise/MachineLearning/blob/master/FSML-2.pdf">here.</a>
